title: NSCoderNight

NSCoderNight is a weekly get-together of Cocoa developers in several cities around the world.  More information is at the main NSCoderNight web site: http://nscodernight.com/

NSCoderNight is a complement to CocoaHeads or other user groups.  Where user groups usually have some more formal meeting structure including presentations, NSCoderNight is all about just getting together for a couple hours with your fellow Cocoa developers and writing code.

If you want to start a get-together in your own city, just respond to one of the weblog posts and I (ChrisHanson) will create a new post for your city that you can use with others in your city to decide on a location.  So far there are NSCoderNight get-togethers in the following areas:

- Silicon Valley, CA
- Washington, DC (Tyson's Corner)

There are proposed NSCoderNight get-togethers in the following areas:

- San Francisco, CA
- Bangor, ME
- Cologne, Germany

And there's an IRC chat room for NSCoderNight on FreeNode at irc://irc.freenode.net/nscodernight of course.
