Hi, trying to create a Custom NSButton which shows a custom image when disabled instead of just dimming the image.  The problem I'm having is      myButton cell] setImageDimsWhenDisabled:FALSE];   doesn't seem to have any effect.

Thoughts, hints?
Thanks -[[HuaYingLing

Are you disabling the button via code only?

Yes, is there an alternative?

*Was there any clarification on this topic? I also need to show some image buttons with a custom disabled image, and would be interested in what solution the OP settled on.*

----

Perhaps an approach is suggested in CustomNSButton
