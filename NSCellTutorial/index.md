Hi, everybody!

I wondered if there are any tutorials for subclassing NSCell for making a custom NSCell class for use with tableView. So that I can have, for example, an image AND a string in the same cell.

Thank you kindly.

Image and text in a cell is no problem.  See /Developer/Examples/AppKit/DragNDropOutlineView which has 
ImageAndTextCell alreday on your hard disk.   You might also want NSBrowserCell
