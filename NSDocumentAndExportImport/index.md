If you're using NSDocument and you want to support exporting and importing of files, you will want to have a closer look at the CFBundleTypeRole key in the Info.plist and the NSExportableAs key. Both are described on the Wiki page for CFBundleTypeRole for now. Just thought I'd add this page to make sure people find this, because I certainly didn't look there.
