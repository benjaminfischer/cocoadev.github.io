**Maybe they should be split into NSPolarAngle(NSPoint point) and NSPolarRadius(NSPoint point) unless we're going to make an NSPolarPoint.**

*Personally, I don't care that much. (: But someone else can if they want, certainly.  Conversion between Cartesian and Polar coordinates would be nice, though, if a new struct were made.*

*Something should be done : split or new struct*

Isn't there some function for converting a point to a string? NSStringFromPoint() in the Foundation API

Otherwise this could be wrapped in a class with four methods returning the different co-ordinates. But if we did that it may as well handle more than two dimensions, and I suspect the whole point of these functions is that they're just little fast things to make the point that we don't need an NSPoint class. :)

If you want a class that handles an arbitrary number of dimensions, ask me about LSVector. It's a reasonably well-tested (although not with UnitTest<nowiki/>s) nesting vector class.

How about using hypot(a, b) for the radius part of the cartesian-to-polar conversion?  It does the whole sqrt(a^2+b^2) thing for you pretty fast.  Plus its a whole lot easier to type.  Also, there is an issue with using atan(y/x), since nothing over Pi radians will be correct.  And when x is 0 there is a *minor* issue with infinity.  A cartesian to polar conversion isn't possible in one (efficient) line as far as I can figure out.

What I usually do is find the asin of fabs(y)/hypot, then put in a case for each quadrant.  For quadrant I, keep the asin, for II, it's pi - asin, for III, pi + asin, and for IV, 2*pi - asin.  That usually works out alright for me.  I have missed the conversion a lot of times before, though, so feel free to correct me.  And if you have a simpler method, I'd love to hear it.  Adios!

Some changes on the cartesian to polar functionï¿½:

- x*x is more efficient than x^2

- atanf is a bad solution : return an angle between 0 and pi, not between 0 and 2*pi. Use atan2f instead.
