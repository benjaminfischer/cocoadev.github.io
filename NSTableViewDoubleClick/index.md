I have an NSTableView that has a double click action configured and what I'm wondering is how to get to the entity that table row is referring to.
The corresponding NSTableColumn is bound to an NSArrayController. And let's say NSArrayController controls objects of type Foo.

How can I get access to these Foo objects from within the double click action handler?

TIA
