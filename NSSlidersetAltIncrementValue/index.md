title: NSSlidersetAltIncrementValue
---



I saw several dead questions on other lists regarding NSSlider setAltIncrementValue. I call this method on my slider in my controller's awakeFromNib ([mySlider setAltIncrementValue:400.0]), and it never seems to work when I press the option key while dragging the slider. I set the value and then check it with NSLog, but it doesn't work. Any ideas?  I saw several similar questions on other posts that didn't have a response.
