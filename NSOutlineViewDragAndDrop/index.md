Hi All,


I am trying to implement drag and drop in NSOutlineView.

I have create NSOutlineView connected it through Interface Builder.
I have also set its delegate.
and then I registered the type of drag.
then I implem writeRows , validateDrop & dropaccept Method.
But When I drap a row, control only goes to WriteRows and it is not going inside ValidateDrop and accept because of which I am not able to drop row.
Any kind of help would b appreciated.


Thanks
Sourabh
