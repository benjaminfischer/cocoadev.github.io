title: NSTextViewFontSetInInterfaceBuilder
---



If I set the font of an NSTextView in InterfaceBuilder, then when test launched from IB, I get this font, but when used in my app, it still uses Lucida Grande -- if, however, I put just one character (even return) in the text view, then the font in my app is what I set in IB.

Is there a way to set the font in IB which does not involve having to also store some characters in the text view?

And is it possible to disable continuous spell checking from InterfaceBuilder? There is a check mark, but it is always disabled.

I'm going to revive this; I would also like to know the answer!  (As for the continuous spell checking question, I've never noticed that.)
