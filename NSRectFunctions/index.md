Based on code by John C. Randolph, but prettied up, renamed and debugged.

Shouldn't this page be named UKRectFunctions?

----

Wow, one would want to go through the trouble of linking against a library with these functions? So,     UKRightCenterOfRect(rect) is that much faster to type then     NSMakePoint(NSMaxX(rect), NSMidY(rect))? And I didn't even use     UKBottomLeftOfRect() as an example!!

Silly if you ask me...
----
It's not that they're that much faster to write, it's that they're faster to *read*.  When you see "bottom left", it's a tad more obvious than NSMaxX()/NSMidY().  

----

You could just #import "UKRectFunctions.h"

Syntax help: No 
Explanation: No 
How to use: No 
 ---Perhaps this page is useless...

*Perhaps you need to learn how to use a C function.*
----
Also, I think these functions are sort of wrong!     NSMax(r) returns     NSMinX(r) + NSWidth(r). When I ask for the top-right point I expect to get     NSMinX(r) + NSWidth(r) - 1, but maybe that is just me?
----
It's consistent with how     NSMaxRange() works. Apple sez: *Returns range.location + range.lengthï¿½in other words, the number 1 greater than the maximum value within the range.*
----
I was referring to the UK-functions, not     NSMaxX. Is the top right corner one greater than the corner inside the view? I guess things get more complicated by the fact that the view coordinate system doesn't really match the screen coordinate system, so filling a single pixel in the top right corner would anyway not be as simple as using the actual coordinate for that place ;)
