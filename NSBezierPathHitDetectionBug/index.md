title: NSBezierPathHitDetectionBug
---



Is the NSBezierPath containsPoint: method bugged? It does not seem to work properly with polygons; it catches points that are outside of the path but inside of the bounds of a path element.

Anyone else have any experience with this?

Or does it by chance only work with convex polygons?

Sounds like a PostYourCode, I'm not aware of any such bug.
