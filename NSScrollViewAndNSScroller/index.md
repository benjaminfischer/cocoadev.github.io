NSScroller has the following constants for controller tint:


*NSDefaultControlTint
*NSClearControlTint
*NSBlueControlTint
*NSGraphiteControlTint


I can only seem to get NSBlueControlTint (Aqua) and NSGraphiteControlTint (Graphite) to work. Has anyone gotten NSClearControlTint to work? If so how?

Thanks

It may only be for the control's inactive state
