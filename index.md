**EDITING HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY DISABLED**

The CocoaDev site is undergoing some big changes to take it into 2013 and beyond. See below for details.

The Skinny
----------

* Converted to full Markdown syntax
* Migrated to a Github repository (clone, modify, pull request)
* Accepted pull requests use Jekyll to convert to static content, push to server

Benefits
--------

* Eliminates wiki-spam
* Manages edit conflicts
* Speeds up live site
* Allows mass edits (yay!)
* Standardizes markup

Timeline
--------

EDITABLE SOON. Check this page for updates.
