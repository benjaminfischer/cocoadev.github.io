An NSMovieView displays an NSMovie (a wrapper for a QuickTime movie) in a frame and provides methods for playing and editing the movie.

**Important**: NSMovieView is obsolete and should not be used for new development. If you are developing for 10.4+, or 10.3 with QuickTime 7 installed, use QTMovieView.
