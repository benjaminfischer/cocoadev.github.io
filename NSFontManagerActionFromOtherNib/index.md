layout: page
title: NSFontManagerActionFromOtherNib

Ok, my MainMenu.nib file has the FontManager class instantiated already (like it does by default). I have another nib file, which contains a panel with a button that I want to activate the orderFrontFontPanel action in the FontManager. How do I do this? Thanks.
