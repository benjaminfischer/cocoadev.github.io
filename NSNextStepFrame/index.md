What is an NSNextStepFrame?? Is it a subclass of NSWindow? It acts like one, but sorta. I'm very confused by it.

ï¿½I've never heard of it myself. It's probably private. For specific but small questions like this, you might want to try asking on Apple's cocoa-dev list, or the mamasam one, or maybe an IRC channel (irc://irc.freenode.net/macdev).

I would, but that draws from the cocoadev community of knowledge. I'm sure someone, three years down the track might want to know the same question. :)

It is indeed private and is a subclass of NSView. You can obtain it by getting the superview of a window's contentView. I don't know much about what it does but it appears to be a window's main view controller for window drawing tasks (such as the titlebar, toolbar, etc.) Use class-dump on AppKit to learn more.

Is this a real problem, or are you just curious?  That's a private class, and you shouldn't need to change behavior based on its details (and you certainly shouldn't rely on its details or existence).  Anyway, it's used with borderless windows.

Since Apple uses it (for the lock button in Safari's title bar), I believe that at the very least a superview of a window's content view, regardless of its class, is going to stay with us for a long while. This is the rationale behind some parts of my Afloat mouse-over code. -- EmanueleVulcano aka millenomi
