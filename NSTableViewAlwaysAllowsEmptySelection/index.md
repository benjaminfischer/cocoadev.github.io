title: NSTableViewAlwaysAllowsEmptySelection

Hello!

Has anyone else noticed that since Leopard NSTableView doesn�t respect allowsEmptySelection:NO anymore?
Whether set in IB or programmatically, and setting the NSArrayController avoidEmptySelection bit doesn�t help.

Am I missing something?

Flofl.
