title: NSXMLEscaping
---

Hi,
I created a class that uses NSXML to create xml files for RSS feeds. In particular for Podcasting. Now in iTunes Podcast Specifications they say that you must escape the following characters: & < > ' ". The NSXML classes can create an element that escapes only some of these characters, such as the < symbol but not the >. What gives? Am I missing something? Thanks for your help in advance.
