**Class Description**

NSDecimalNumberHandler is a class that adopts the NSDecimalNumberBehaviors protocol. This class allows you to set the way an NSDecimalNumber rounds off and handles errors, without having to create a custom class.

You can use an instance of this class as an argument to any of the NSDecimalNumber methods that end with ...Behavior:. If you don�t think you need special behavior, you probably don�t need this class. The odds are that NSDecimalNumber�s default behavior will suit your needs.


For more information, see the NSDecimalNumberBehaviors protocol specification.
